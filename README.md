A visual database that connects to The Movie Database (TMDB) API, gathering information on movies, TV shows and actors. The page contains three sections for movies, one section for TV shows and one section for actors. On each movie or TV show page, there is a component which suggests similar movies and also shows actors that are part of the production's cast. Likewise, for every actor, there is a component which indicates in which movies the actor/actress plays.
